# NYT_Topic_Modeling

The goal of this project is to visualize how the topics of articles on the front page of the New York Times changes over time. This project is useful because it will allow us to see the lifespan of specific news topics and allow us to gauge which topic are becoming more frequent and which topics are becoming less frequent. In order to build this model, I scraped the front page of The New York Times for the last month using the archive pages and then placed the text of all articles into a data frame. After that I created a gensim DTM model.
